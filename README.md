This demo walkthrough is largely inspired to the Cisco DevNet [ACI and Kubernetes](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/sandbox/#!data-center) sandbox, which offers three different learning paths and eight labs in a dedicated environment you can use at your convenience:

- Option 1: Detailed Learning Lab Walkthrough of Installation, Integration, and Application Deployment (3+ hours of content)

- Option 2: Follow the Quick Start Guide for details on the key steps in installing Kubernetes and the ACI CNI plug-in (about 30 minutes to working cluster)

- Option 3: Run the "auto-deploy" script to prepare and install Kubernetes and the ACI CNI plug-in and immediately have a working cluster. (8 minutes to working cluster)
